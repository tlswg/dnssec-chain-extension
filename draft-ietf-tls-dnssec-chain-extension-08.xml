      This draft describes a new TLS extension for
      transport of a DNS record set serialized with the DNSSEC
      signatures needed to authenticate that record set.  The
      intent of this proposal is to allow TLS clients to
      perform DANE authentication of a TLS server
      without needing to perform additional DNS
      record lookups.  It is not intended to be used to validate
      the TLS server's address records.

  <section title="Introduction">
    <t>
      This draft describes a new TLS
      <xref target="RFC5246"/> <xref target="TLS13"/>
      extension
      for transport of a DNS record set serialized with the
      <xref target="RFC4034">DNSSEC signatures</xref> needed
      to authenticate that record set.  The intent of this
      proposal is to allow TLS clients to perform DANE
      Authentication <xref target="RFC6698" />
      <xref target="RFC7671" /> of a TLS
      server without performing
      additional DNS record lookups and incurring the
      associated latency penalty. It also provides the
      ability to avoid potential problems with TLS clients
      being unable to look up DANE records because of an
      interfering or broken middlebox on the path between
      the client and a DNS server <xref target="HAMPERING"/>.
      And lastly, it allows a
      TLS client to validate the server's DANE (TLSA) records
      itself without needing access to a validating DNS resolver
      to which it has a secure connection.
    </t>

    <t>
      This mechanism is useful
      for TLS applications that need to address the problems
      described above, typically web browsers or SIP/VoIP
      <xref target="RFC3261"/> and XMPP <xref target="RFC7590"/>.
      It may not be relevant for many other
      applications. For example, SMTP MTAs are usually
      located in data centers, may tolerate
      extra DNS lookup latency, are on servers where it is
      easier to provision a validating resolver, or are
      less likely to experience traffic interference from
      misconfigured middleboxes. Furthermore, SMTP MTAs usually
      employ <xref target="RFC7672">Opportunistic Security</xref>,
      in which the presence of the DNS TLSA records is used to determine
      whether to enforce an authenticated TLS connection.
      Hence DANE authentication of SMTP MTAs will typically not use 
      this mechanism.
    </t>

    <t>
      The extension described here allows a TLS client to request that
      the TLS server return the DNSSEC authentication chain corresponding
      to its DANE record. If the server is configured for DANE authentication,
      then it performs the appropriate DNS queries, builds the authentication
      chain, and returns it to the client. The server will usually use a
      previously cached authentication chain, but it will need to rebuild it
      periodically as described in <xref target="sec_caching" />. The client
      then authenticates the chain using a pre-configured trust anchor.
    </t>

    <t>
      This specification is based on Adam Langley's original
      proposal for serializing DNSSEC authentication chains
      and delivering them in an X.509 certificate extension
      <xref target="I-D.agl-dane-serializechain" />. It modifies the approach by using
      wire format DNS records in the serialized data (assuming
      that the data will be prepared and consumed by a DNS-specific
      library), and by using a TLS extension to deliver the data.
    </t>

    <t>
      As described in the DANE specification <xref target="RFC6698" />
      <xref target="RFC7671" />, this
      procedure applies to the DANE authentication of X.509
      certificates or raw public keys <xref target="RFC7250" />.
    </t>

  <section title="DNSSEC Authentication Chain Extension">
    <section title="Protocol, TLS 1.2">

    <t>
      A client MAY include an extension of type
      "dnssec_chain" in the (extended) ClientHello.  The
      "extension_data" field of this extension MUST be
      empty.
    </t>

    <t>
      Servers receiving a "dnssec_chain" extension in the
      ClientHello and which are capable of being authenticated
      via DANE, return a serialized authentication chain
      in the extended ServerHello message using the format
      described below.  If a server is unable to return an
      authentication chain, or does not wish to return an
      authentication chain, it does not include a dnssec_chain
      extension.  As with all TLS extensions, if the server
      does not support this extension it will not return any
      authentication chain.
    </t>

    </section> <!-- protocol 1.2 -->

    <section title="Protocol, TLS 1.3">

      <t>
        A client MAY include an extension of type
        "dnssec_chain" in the ClientHello.  The
        "extension_data" field of this extension MUST be

      <t>
        Servers receiving a "dnssec_chain" extension in the
        ClientHello, and which are capable of being authenticated
        via DANE, return a serialized authentication chain
        in the extension block of the Certificate message containing
        the end entity certificate being validated, using the format
        described below.
      </t>

      <t>
        The extension protocol behavior otherwise follows that specified
        for TLS version 1.2.
      </t>

    </section> <!-- protocol 1.3 -->

    <section title="Raw Public Keys">
      <t>
        <xref target="RFC7250" /> specifies the use of raw
        public keys for both server and client
        authentication in TLS 1.2.  It points out that in
        cases where raw public keys are being used, code for
        certificate path validation is not
        required. However, DANE, when used in conjunction
        with the dnssec_chain extension, provides a mechanism for
        securely binding a raw public key to a named entity
        in the DNS, and when using DANE for authentication a
        raw key may be validated using a path chaining back
        to a DNSSEC trust root.  This has the added benefit
        of mitigating an unknown key share attack, as
        described in <xref target="I-D.barnes-dane-uks" />,
        since it effectively augments the raw public key
        with the server's name and provides a means to
        commit both the server and the client to using that
        binding. 
      </t>

      <t>
        The UKS attack is possible in situations in which
        the association between a domain name and a public
        key is not tightly bound, as in the case in DANE in
        which a client either ignores the name in the
        certificate (as specified in <xref target="RFC7671"
        />) or there is no attestation of trust outside of
        the DNS.  The vulnerability arises in the following
        situations: 
      </t>
      <t>
        <list style="symbols">
          <t>If the client does not verify the identity in the
            server's certificate (as recommended in Section
            5.1 of [RFC7671]), then an attacker can induce the
            client to accept an unintended identity for the
            server, 
          </t>

          <t>If the client allows the use of raw public keys
            in TLS, then it will not receive any
            indication of the server's identity in the TLS
            channel, and is thus unable to check that the
            server's identity is as intended.
          </t>
        </list>
      </t>

      <t>The mechanism for conveying DNSSEC validation
        chains described in this document results in a
        commitment by both parties, via the TLS
        handshake, to a validated domain name and EE key.</t>

      <t>The mechanism for encoding DNSSEC authentication
        chains in a TLS extension, as described in this
        document, is not limited to public keys encapsulated
        in X.509 containers but MAY be applied to raw
        public keys and other representations, as well.
      </t>
    </section>

    
    <section title="DNSSEC Authentication Chain Data"
             anchor="auth_chain_data">

      <t>
    The "extension_data" field of the "dnssec_chain" extension 
    MUST contain a DNSSEC Authentication Chain encoded in the
    following form:
      </t>

      <figure>
        <artwork>

          opaque AuthenticationChain&lt;1..2^16-1&gt;
        </artwork>
      </figure>

      <t>
    The AuthenticationChain structure is composed of a sequence of 
    uncompressed wire format DNS resource record sets (RRset) and 
    corresponding signatures (RRSIG) record sets.
      </t>

      <t>
    This sequence of native DNS wire format records enables easier
    generation of the data structure on the server and easier 
    verification of the data on client by means of existing DNS library
    functions.
      </t>

      <t>
    Each RRset in the chain is composed of a sequence of wire format
    DNS resource records. The format of the resource record is 
    described in <xref target="RFC1035">RFC 1035</xref>, Section
    3.2.1.
      </t>

      <figure>
        <artwork>

          RR(i) = owner | type | class | TTL | RDATA length | RDATA

          where RR(i) denotes the ith RR.
        </artwork>
      </figure>

      <t>
    The resource records that make up a RRset all have the same owner,
    type and class, but different RDATA as specified
    <xref target="RFC2181">RFC 2181</xref>, Section 5.

    Each RRset in the sequence is followed by its associated
    RRsig record set.  This RRset has the same owner and class as the
    preceding RRset, but has type RRSIG.  The Type Covered 
    field in the RDATA of the RRsigs identifies the type of the
    preceding RRset as described in
    <xref target="RFC4034">RFC 4034</xref>, Section 3.

    The RRsig record wire format is described in
    <xref target="RFC4034">RFC 4034</xref>, Section 3.1. The 
    signature portion of the RDATA, as described in the same
    section, is the following:
      </t>

      <figure>
        <artwork>

          signature = sign(RRSIG_RDATA | RR(1) | RR(2)... )
        </artwork>
      </figure>

      <t>
    where RRSIG_RDATA is the wire format of the RRSIG RDATA
    fields with the Signer's Name field in canonical form and
    the signature field excluded.
      </t>

      <t>
        The first RRset in the chain MUST contain the TLSA record set
        being presented. However, if the owner name of the TLSA record
        set is an alias (CNAME or DNAME), then it MUST be preceded by the
        chain of alias records needed to resolve it. DNAME chains SHOULD
        omit unsigned CNAME records that may have been synthesized in the
        response from a DNS resolver. (If unsigned synthetic CNAMES are
        present, then the TLS client will just ignore them, as they are
        not necessary to validate the chain.)
      </t>

      <t>
        The subsequent RRsets MUST contain the full set
        of DNS records needed to authenticate the TLSA record set from the
        server's trust anchor. Typically this means a set of DNSKEY
        and DS RRsets that cover all zones from the target zone containing
        the TLSA record set to the trust anchor zone. The TLS client should
        be prepared to receive this set of RRsets in any order.
      </t>

      <t>
        Names that are aliased via CNAME and/or DNAME records may involve
        multiple branches of the DNS tree. In this case, the authentication
        chain structure needs to include DS and DNSKEY record sets that
        cover all the necessary branches.
      </t>

      <t>
        If the TLSA record set was synthesized by a DNS wildcard, the
        chain MUST include the signed NSEC or <xref target="RFC5155">
        NSEC3</xref> records that prove
        that there was no explicit match of the TLSA record name and no
        closer wildcard match.
      </t>

      <t>
        The final DNSKEY RRset in the authentication chain corresponds
        to the trust anchor (typically the DNS root). This trust anchor 
        is also preconfigured in the TLS client, but including it in the 
        response from the server permits TLS clients to use the automated 
        trust anchor rollover mechanism defined in RFC 5011 
        <xref target="RFC5011" /> to update their configured trust anchor.
      </t>

      <t>
        The following is an example of the records in the
        AuthenticationChain structure for the HTTPS server at
        www.example.com, where there are zone cuts at "com."
        and "example.com." (record data are omitted here for brevity):

        <t>
        TLS servers that do not have a signed TLSA record MAY instead
        return a DNSSEC chain that provides authenticated denial of
        existence. This specification does not require TLS servers to
        provide such a denial of existence chain, otherwise it could
        not be deployed incrementally in environments where not all TLS
        servers support this extension.

  <section title="Construction of Serialized Authentication Chains">

    <t>
      This section describes a possible procedure for the
      server to use to build the serialized DNSSEC chain.
    </t>

    <t>When the goal is to perform DANE authentication 
       <xref target="RFC6698" /> <xref target="RFC7671" /> of the 
       server, the DNS record set to be
       serialized is a TLSA record set corresponding to the 
       server's domain name, protocol, and port number.
    </t>

    <t>
      The domain name of the server MUST be that included in
      the TLS server_name extension <xref target="RFC6066"
      /> when present. If the server_name extension is not
      present, or if the server does not recognize the
      provided name and wishes to proceed with the handshake
      rather than to abort the connection, the server picks
      one of its configured domain names associated with the
      server IP address to which the connection has been established.
    </t>

    <t>
      The TLSA record to be queried is constructed by prepending
      the _port and _transport labels to the domain name as described
      in <xref target="RFC6698" />, where "port" is the port number
      associated with the TLS server.  The transport is "tcp"
      for TLS servers, and "udp" for DTLS servers.  The port
      number label is the left-most label, followed by the
      transport, followed by the base domain name.
    </t>

    <t>
      The components of the authentication chain are typically built by
      starting at the target record set and its corresponding RRSIG.
      Then traversing the DNS tree upwards towards the trust anchor
      zone (normally the DNS root), for each zone cut, the DNSKEY and
      DS RRsets and their signatures are added. However, see
      <xref target="auth_chain_data" /> for specific processing needed for
      aliases and wildcards. If DNS response messages contain any
      domain names utilizing name compression
      <xref target="RFC1035"/>, then they MUST be uncompressed.
    </t>

    <t>
      Newer DNS protocol enhancements, such as the <xref target="RFC7901">
      EDNS Chain Query extension</xref> if supported, may offer easier ways
      to obtain all of the chain data in one transaction with an upstream
      DNSSEC aware recursive server.
    </t>

  </section> <!-- construction -->


  <section title="Caching and Regeneration of the Authentication Chain"
       anchor="sec_caching">
    <t>
      DNS records have Time To Live (TTL) parameters, and DNSSEC
      signatures have validity periods (specifically signature expiration
      times). After the TLS server constructs the serialized authentication
      chain, it SHOULD cache and reuse it in multiple TLS connection
      handshakes. However, it MUST refresh and rebuild the chain as TTLs
      and signature validity periods dictate. A server implementation 
      could carefully track these parameters and requery component records
      in the chain correspondingly. Alternatively, it could be configured 
      to rebuild the entire chain at some predefined periodic interval that 
      does not exceed the DNS TTLs or signature validity periods of the 
      component records in the chain.
    </t>
  </section>


  <section title="Verification" anchor="sec_verification">

    <t>
      A TLS client making use of this specification, and
      which receives a DNSSEC authentication chain extension
      from a server, MUST use this information to perform
      DANE authentication of the server.  In
      order to do this, it uses the mechanism specified by
      the DNSSEC protocol <xref target="RFC4035"/> <xref target="RFC5155"/>.
      This mechanism is sometimes implemented in a DNSSEC
      validation engine or library.
    </t>

    <t>
        If the authentication chain is correctly verified, the client then
        performs DANE authentication of the server according to the DANE TLS
        protocol <xref target="RFC6698"/> <xref target="RFC7671"/>.
    </t>

    <t>
      Clients MAY cache the server's validated TLSA RRset or other
      validated portions of the chain as an optimization to save
      signature verification work for future connections. The
      period of such caching MUST NOT exceed the TTL associated with
      those records. A client that possesses a validated and unexpired
      TLSA RRset or the full chain in its cache does not need to send the
      dnssec_chain extension for subsequent connections to the same TLS
      server. It can use the cached information to perform DANE
      authentication.

  <section title="Trust Anchor Maintenance" anchor="sec_trustmaint">

    <t>
      The trust anchor may change periodically, e.g. when the operator
      of the trust anchor zone performs a DNSSEC key rollover. TLS
      clients using this specification MUST implement a mechanism to
      keep their trust anchors up to date. They could use the method
      defined in <xref target="RFC5011" /> to perform trust anchor
      updates inband in TLS, by tracking the introduction of new keys
      seen in the trust anchor DNSKEY RRset. However, alternative
      mechanisms external to TLS may also be utilized. Some operating systems
      may have a system-wide service to maintain and keep the root trust
      anchor up to date. In such cases, the TLS client application
      could simply reference that as its trust anchor, periodically 
      checking whether it has changed. Some applications may prefer to
      implement trust anchor updates as part of their automated software
      updates.
    </t>

  </section> <!-- trust anchor maintenance  -->


  <section title="Mandating use of this extension" anchor="mandating">

    <t>
      Green field applications that are designed to always employ this
      extension, could of course unconditionally mandate its use.
    </t>

    <t>
      This protocol allows TLS servers to prove that they don't have a
      signed TLSA record by returning a denial of existence chain.
      However, as explained in <xref target="denial_of_existence"/>,
      it does not require TLS servers to do so. In the absence of such
      a proof, a TLS client misdirected to a server that has fraudulently
      acquired a public CA issued certificate for the real server's name,
      could be induced to establish a PKIX verified connection to the rogue
      server that precluded DANE authentication. Application ecosystems
      where all TLS servers are expected to implement this extension could
      require such authenticated denial proofs to be delivered by TLS
      servers that don't have signed TLSA records.
    </t>

    <t>
      One possible way to address the threat of attackers that have
      fraudulently obtained valid PKIX credentials, is to use current
      PKIX defense mechanisms, such as checking Certificate Transparency
      logs to detect certificate misissuance. This may be necessary anyway,
      as TLS servers may support both DANE and PKIX authentication. Even
      TLS servers that support only DANE may be interested in detecting
      PKIX adversaries impersonating their service to DANE unaware TLS
      clients.
    </t>

  </section>


  <section title="DANE and Traditional PKIX Interoperation" anchor="pkix-interop">

    <t>
      When DANE is being introduced incrementally into an existing
      PKIX environment, there may be scenarios in which DANE
      authentication for a server fails but PKIX succeeds, or vice versa.
      What happens here depends on TLS client policy. If DANE authentication
      fails, the client may decide to fallback to traditional PKIX
      authentication. In order to do so efficiently within the same
      TLS handshake, the TLS server needs to have provided the full
      X.509 certificate chain. When TLS servers only support DANE-EE
      or DANE-TA modes, they have the option to send a much smaller
      certificate chain: just the EE certificate for the former, and
      a short certificate chain from the DANE trust anchor to the EE
      certificate for the latter. If the TLS server supports both DANE
      and traditional PKIX, and wants to allow efficient PKIX fallback
      within the same handshake, they should always provide the full
      X.509 certificate chain.
    </t>

  </section>


  <section title="Security Considerations">

    <t> 
      The security considerations of the normatively referenced RFCs 
      all pertain to 
      this extension. Since the server is delivering a chain of DNS 
      records and signatures to the client, it MUST rebuild the chain
      in accordance with TTL and signature expiration of
      the chain components as described in <xref target="sec_caching" />.
      TLS clients need roughly accurate time in order to properly
      authenticate these signatures. This could be achieved by running
      a time synchronization protocol like NTP <xref target="RFC5905" /> 
      or SNTP <xref target="RFC5905" />, which are already widely used 
      today. TLS clients MUST support a mechanism to track and rollover 
      the trust anchor key, or be able to avail themselves of a service 
      that does this, as described in <xref target="sec_trustmaint" />.
      Security considerations related to mandating the use of this
      extension are described in <xref target="mandating" />.
    </t>

  </section>


  <section title="IANA Considerations">

    <t>This extension requires the registration of a new
      value in the TLS ExtensionsType registry.  The value
      requested from IANA is 53, and the extension should
      be marked "Recommended" in accordance with "IANA Registry
      Updates for TLS and DTLS" <xref target="TLSIANA"/>.
